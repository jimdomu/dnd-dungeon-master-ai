    "World Memory: Implement persistent storage of state for each location. The AI must recognize when players revisit a location and present an updated description reflecting prior actions.\n",

    "Map Generation and Navigation: The AI should create and maintain a coherent map of connected locations, ensuring logical placement and connections.\n",

    "Dynamic Descriptions and Interactions: Generate unique descriptions and manage NPC or item states dynamically, adapting based on player actions.\n",
    "Randomized Location Descriptions and Encounters: When players enter a new location, the AI generates a fresh, random description consistent with nearby areas and may spawn new NPCs or items. This allows each exploration to feel novel and immersive while maintaining a coherent world.\n",

    "\n",
    "NPC Interaction and Combat\n",
    "NPCs have two attributes: Health Points (HP) and Attack Power.\n",
    "Combat: When players engage in combat, each side rolls a virtual 1d6 (a six-sided die) and adds it to their Attack Power to determine damage for that turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Victory Conditions: The player wins if the NPC’s HP reaches zero, and loses if their own HP does.\n",
    "Skill Checks and Random Outcomes\n",
    "When players attempt a risky action (e.g., unlocking a door), the AI rolls a 1d10 (a ten-sided die) for a skill check.\n",
    "For simple tasks, a roll of 3 or higher succeeds.\n",
    "For challenging tasks, a roll of 6 or higher is needed.\n",
    "Descriptions should vary based on success or failure, giving the interaction a creative touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory and Simple Item Use\n",
    "Players can pick up and use basic items like keys or healing potions.\n",
    "Items: Each item has a single effect—e.g., a potion heals 10 HP, a key unlocks a specific door.\n",
    "The AI remembers which items have been used or taken to manage inventory without complex tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience Points and Leveling (Optional)\n",
    "Players can gain Experience Points (XP) for completing significant actions or defeating NPCs.\n",
    "When players reach 50 XP, they \"level up,\" gaining a small HP increase.\n",
    "This provides a sense of progression with minimal complexity."
